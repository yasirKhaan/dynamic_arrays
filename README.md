# dynamic_arrays
Arrays are of fixed size but here these Dynamic Arrays have no limits or pre defined size. All you have to do is just insert values without worrying about size.
In python usually array are in form of list which does not contain fixed size but a module named "array" is being used in python to get proper functionality of array with fixed size.
While adding elements on array if you face OverFlow() condition it will automatically increase the size of array without throwing an error.
